    <h1>Combatting Information Decay</h1>
    <p>Measuring information degredation in mediation through the use of a new unit of measurement, Rands</p>

        <div class="quote">
            We all know news is fake and gay, but the question is HOW fake? Can we actually measure the degradation? I think we can. My theory is that every time information passes through a medium, like from the raw truth of an event to the first reporting, to secondary reporting based on the first reporting, to word of mouth, etc., the information loses fidelity. This itself is proven already in data science. You cannot create information through processing it. By the nature of what information is, you can only preserve or destroy it. Additionally, often times what is added is just a lot of noise. Most journalists today are just high-performance noise generators, and most media you consume is primarily made up of noise.
        </div>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h3>The Rand (R)</h3>
            <p>A unit of transmission fidelity, the Rand is the inverse of the rate of information decay in transmission. It measures the delta between two sources (so, naturally, no singular source holds any value in Rands, as Rands measure the degredation between two sources). 1.0 Rand represents lossless transmission. 0.5 Rands represents a loss of half the information being transmitted. 0 Rands represents just total entropic noise where the original signal or message is wholly obliterated. To calculate Rands, you basically just identify the bits of discrete information in the original source, and count how many survive mediation. The Preserved Information divided by the Original Information, to the power of one divided by the number of levels of mediation, equals the transmission efficiency in Rands. The more original information is preserved, the higher the Rands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <h3>The Prototaxis</h3>
            <p>A major challenge in measuring Rands is measuring bits of information in speech and semantic communication. It's possible, just very difficult. There is such a thing as bits of information in speech, though it's very hard to measure. My solution to this is the Prototaxis, the smallest discrete packet of semantic information, and an alternative to the standard method of measuring amounts of data in semantic communication. To count as <strong>1 Prototaxis</strong>, a statement must establish a Subject-Predicate-Referent chain verifiable as a physical interaction. If it's just a value judgment, like "the vibes are bad", it holds 0 prototaxis. The premises behind this are firstly that for a unit of information to exist, it must refer to a discrete entity with specific properties. If a statement doesn't identify a thing, it contains 0 bits, naturally. Secondly, concepts are measurements omitted. So a Bit of truth is the successful identification of a referent in reality. Thirdly, truth claims are only valid if they don't contradict the physical reality of their conveyance. This is the famed Axiom of Action. Information must be tied to verifiable propositions regarding physical entities and their movements in spacetime. Essentially, the prototaxis is the smallest discrete propositional statement that identifies a specific entity and ascribes to it a non-contradictory action or attribute verifiable within a physical causal chain. To discretize speech, we must break it down into the smallest possible packet that satisfies these three constraints.</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
            <h3>The usefulness</h3>
            <p>The reason why I think the measurement of this loss is useful is because if you measure loss between two mediation layers, you can extrapolate BACKWARDS to estimate how much of the original unmediated event is lost, even if you never saw it. Like measuring radioactive decay to date something. You can then engage in a sort of forensic reconstruction of actual events from the propaganda. It's basically a way of quantifying the telephone game effect.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>The current media class operates on the assumption that reality is socially constructed, as opposed to the reality, which is, simply, reality. Our world exists! We live in it! Cogito, ergo sum! By using the Rand scale, we can apply the Axiom of Action to journalism. We can treat news like radioactive isotopes, measuring the decay rate between two known points to extrapolate the amount of truth lost.</p>
        <p>If you see a post about a news article, and the article has 10 prototaxis while the post only preserves 2, you have a Rand value of 0.2. If that article was already 3 stages removed from the event, you can guess that the original event was orders of magnitude more complex than the slop being fed to you.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>There will be some level of inaccuracy in the determination of the amount of lost unmediated information. If information is lost, we cannot recover it through any algorithm, and this includes information on how much information was lost. It will not be extraordinarily precise, but I think it will serve to give a very good estimate of how much information has been lost after a number of layers of mediation. You will not be able to determine with 100% certainty that, for example, an original raw image was 712mb, but you can reach that estimate and rely on it being approximate to reality. We cannot assume that the Rands between stages of transmission are uniform, but this is the only way we can realistically extrapolate between two data points. The idea is to use known datapoints to extrapolate to the unknown. Obviously, you cannot know the unknown. You cannot know for certainty the Rands between the original unmediated information and the later mediated information without knowing the unmediated information. But you can extrapolate between two layers of mediated information to estimate roughly how much has been lost from the original unmediated information.</p>
